**Tableau Visualization: Business Analysis for Dognition** (Updated Mar.2024)

[Dognition](https://www.dognition.com/) is a company that offers online games and assessments designed to help dog owners better understand their pet's behavior and cognition. In this project, I investigated the reason behind drop-offs after the completion of each game, created visualizations using calculation fields and table calculations from multiple blend data sources, and presented my solutions using dashboard and story.
