Hello, I'm Sitian Zhou! Growing up in Zhoushan, China, I had the wonderful experience in a cozy coastal town in Southern China for the first 18 years of my life.

The next chapter led me to the University of California, Davis, where I delved into the world of Biotechnology for my undergrad. At UC Davis, I actively applied my coding skills and my knowledge in biology to a research project on tomato plants, where I conduct bioinformatic analysis on tomato genes.

Now, I find myself at Columbia University, enthusiastically working towards a Master's degree in biostatistics. In the first year of study, I expanded my coding skills to SQL and SAS, and also developed a solid understanding in statistics and applied them to several projects. 


Life's journey has been quite exciting so far, and I'm thrilled to see where it takes me next!
