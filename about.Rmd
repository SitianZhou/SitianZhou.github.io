Hello, I'm Sitian Zhou! I had the wonderful experience of growing up in a cozy coastal town in Southern China for the first 18 years of my life. The next chapter led me to the University of California, Davis, where I delved into the world of Biotechnology for my undergrad. Now, I find myself at Columbia University, enthusiastically working towards a Master's degree in biostatistics. Life's journey has been quite exciting so far, and I'm thrilled to see where it takes me next!
